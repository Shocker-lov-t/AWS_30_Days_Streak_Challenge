<u><strong>What is IAM?</strong></u>
<br>

Stands for Identity and Access Management.

IAM is a web service in AWS that helps manage user access to AWS resources.

IAM allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and control their permissions to access AWS services.

IAM provides a way to securely manage access to AWS resources, without having to share AWS account credentials.

IAM is used to control who is authenticated and authorized to use AWS resources.

The first identity in IAM is the root user, which has access to all AWS resources.

The primary resources in IAM are users, groups, roles, policies, and identity providers.

IAM roles are like IAM users, but they are intended to be assumed by anyone who needs them, and they do not have any credentials associated with them.

IAM can be used from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDK.
